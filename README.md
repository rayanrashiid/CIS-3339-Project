# Data Platform Project Setup

This project has been developed over time by students in the CIS 4339 course.

The current iteration is based on development done by:
* Jeremy Griffith and Edwin Charly in Spring of 2023
* Elliot Farmer Garcia, Agatha	Molski and Chris Blanco in Fall of 2022.

## Requirements

This project uses NodeJS, VUEJS and MongoDB.

## Backend Node Application
```
cd backend
```
Follow instructions in backend README for setup and running as a local instance.

## Frontend Vue 3 Application
```
cd frontend
```
Follow instructions in frontend README for setup and running as a local instance.

## Applying Patch Commands Locally

If you receive a `git apply <<'PATCH' ... PATCH` snippet and your terminal appears to "hang" after the `EOF`, the shell is waiting for you to finish pasting the block. Make sure you copy every line from the opening `git apply` command through the final `PATCH`. After pasting, press **Enter** once more and then **Ctrl+D** (or **Cmd+D** on macOS) to signal end-of-file input. Git will then apply the changes and return control to your prompt. Run `git status` to confirm the updated files before staging and committing them.
